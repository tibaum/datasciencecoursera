## Raw Data

The raw data is obtained from the following source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The accompanying website is: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

The unzipped archive results in a folder `UCI HAR Dataset`. The following files from this folder are used in this project:
* train/y_train.txt
* train/subject_train.txt
* train/X_train.txt
* test/y_test.txt
* test/subject_test.txt
* test/X_test.txt
* features.txt
* activity_labels.txt

A description of the raw data and licence information are provided in the files `README.txt` and `features_info.txt` which are also contained in the folder `UCI HAR Dataset`.
